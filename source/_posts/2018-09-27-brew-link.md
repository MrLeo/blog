- `brew doctor`

  ```shell
  brew dr
  ```

  This will give you the:
  'Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar...'
  message

  underneath this message it will prompt which kegs are there with the potential problem. My personal warning was:

  ```shell
  Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:
  	mongodb
  ```

- `brew link`

  read your options, so you understand what is happening with this command.

<!--more-->

- `brew link --dry-run <yourArgument>`

  Homebrew will list all files which would be linked or which would be deleted by brew link --overwrite, but will not actually link or delete any files.

- `brew link --overwrite <yourArgument>`

  This will execute what the dry-run did, for real this time.

  My experience with this was:
  _cli cmnd:brew link --overwrite mongodb_
  _cli response: Linking /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.2.7... 0 symlinks created_

- `brew doctor` Finally I ran this command and my response no longer had issues.

  _cli response: Your system is ready to brew._
